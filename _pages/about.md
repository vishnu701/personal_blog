I started my programming journey with learning C and C++, then data structures and python. 
I am eager to explore all spheres and aspects of technology and whilst at it, I have quite developed my interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 
I have been reading and learning stuff about Computer Vision and even have been working to learn and contribute more towards Open Source. My journey so far has been amazing and my quest to learn more and more keeps me going everyday!

I'd love to catch up to interact and exchange our learnings. Ciao!
