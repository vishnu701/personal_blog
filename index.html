Hey buddy! This is my blog, I'm glad to have you here!

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/diagram.png "https://github.com/fastai/fastpages")

[Vishnu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnu701/) is a pre-final year Computer Science Undergrad who is passionate about Deep Learning and Computer Vision!
Not sure what brought you here, but quite excited to know what you'll be taking away after reading my blogs! Be a reader to my blogs and I'm always up for constructive criticism! Let's talk about what facsinates you about Neutal Nets and get our hands dirty with logics and loopholes.
Also, if you are looking for a research buddy like me, maybe we could use a common interest about Deep Learning?
